    <p>Human-curated list of domains which abuse your email adress.</p>
    <p>Hey, it looks like you have mistakenly placed my domain on your list. Can you please remove it?<br />No, no mistakes were made (by the maintainers). If your domain ends up on this list, you have likely committed one of the following:<ol><li>Failed to implement adaquate subscription management functionality.</li><li>Poor security hygiene.</li><li>Partnered with one or more third parties that have abused email addresses.</li></ol><br />If you find this unsatisfactory, you may try:<ol><li>Implementing adaquate email subscription management functionality.</li><li>Send future emails in plain text. Not only are plain text entirely accessible to everyone, but true spam is much more easily filtered out.</li><li>Sign your emails cryptographically. This would make it harder for others to tarnish your (email) reputation.</li></ol><br />It is impossible to know whether using any of the advice above will help, but it is certainly worth trying.</p>
